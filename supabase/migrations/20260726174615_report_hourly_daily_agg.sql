-- The daily/monthly report builder previously fetched every raw reading
-- row (paginated 1000 at a time) and aggregated it in JS. For sites with
-- frequent readings (e.g. every 15s across many meters), a single day's
-- data required dozens of paginated Supabase calls, which on Cloudflare
-- Workers blows through the "subrequests per invocation" limit before the
-- report email is even sent ("Too many subrequests by single Worker
-- invocation"). These functions do the aggregation in Postgres instead,
-- so the report builder only needs ONE query per report.

-- Daily report: one row per meter per UTC hour bucket (matches the
-- existing hourKey = UTC hour behavior in send-reports.ts).

-- Dropping the constraint first also removes its backing index; a
